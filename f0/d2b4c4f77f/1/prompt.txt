Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Create CLAUDE.md

## Context
The repository has no existing CLAUDE.md, cursor rules, or copilot instructions. The README is a minimal template description. A CLAUDE.md needs to be created to help future Claude Code instances quickly understand this TanStack Start application.

## Action
Create `CLAUDE.md` at the project root with the following content:

### Sections to include:
1. **Development Commands** — dev (port 4008), build, test, lint, format, check commands using bun
2. **Tech Stack** — TanStack Start + React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (base-maia style with Base UI headless components)
3. **Architecture** — File-based routing via TanStack Router, route files in `src/routes/`, UI components in `src/components/ui/`, shared utils in `src/lib/`
4. **Key Conventions** — Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`, no semicolons/single quotes (Prettier), `cn()` utility for class merging, component variant pattern with CVA, `data-slot` attributes on components, compound component pattern (e.g. Select.Root/Trigger/Content)
5. **Adding UI Components** — `bunx shadcn add <component>` (base-maia style, non-RSC)

### Files to create/modify:
- **Create**: `/Users/kakarot/Self/Sandbox/tan-mapper-app/CLAUDE.md`

## Verification
- Read the created file to confirm accuracy
- Ensure no duplicated or generic content


If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/kakarot/.claude/projects/-Users-kakarot-Self-Sandbox-tan-mapper-app/a0b5652f-0dab-4270-a01d-52a7e6b7c0ab.jsonl

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.
